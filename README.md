# Chromatica
Chromatica is a way for color blind individuals to have corrected vision within Google Chrome—for free. It aims to target the problem of a lack of proper color correction tools on the internet. As of such, we will attempt to both correct color and augment colors in situations where—for example, in graphs and charts—there are many colors in an image and a user might want more information about what color they are looking at. Our group decided to target color blindness users on the internet; current technology tied to browsers like Chrome and Firefox allow for personalized tools—in our case, it is going to be for a plugin that both corrects and augments one's’ color vision.
